			<h2>HISTORY</h2>
			<p>Over 65 years ago at Bordertown, in the big red gum country of the beautiful Tatiara District, the Steer family commenced Stud cattle breeding. The Stud was the outcome of over twenty years of successful commercial cattle breeding. In 1950 Barton and Auriel Steer and their sons Warren and Frank founded the Cannawigra Poll Hereford stud. In 1966, the late Warren Steer, and his sons Christopher and Neville founded the Warrensville Poll Hereford stud with his portion of the Cannawigra herd, under the ownership of BLW Steer and Sons.</p>
			
			<p>The basic policy of the Stud has always been to produce quality Poll Herefords with emphasis on high weight for age. Careful attention was placed on the foundation females, having already over 20 years of experience in breeding commercial cattle. By placing emphasis on lactation, ease of calving, temperament and other maternal qualities, Warrensville has a herd of exceptional Poll Hereford mothers. The special attention placed on the breeding herd such as the purchase of 9 of the top females at the Glen Osmond Dispersal  for $53,000 in 1974, has allowed sires used in the Stud to achieve maximum potential. Warrensville is a unique source of valuable Poll Hereford genes.</p>
			
			<h3>The Female Lines</h3>
			
			<p>It has always been our aim to maintain the females at the highest possible standard.</p>
			
			<p>Heifers of particular quality and of the famous Milton park bloodlines were procured when the entire herd of Mr WFS Robertson of Nyroca was purchased as the foundation. Their dams were Milton Park cows by the celebrated Trumode Domino 16th IMP USA. The Lady Redfield and Lady Huron families still continue today; Warrensville Lady Redfield 66th being Senior and grand Champion at the 19074 and 1975 Adelaide Royal Shows and dam of Warrensville Lady Huron 84, Australian Top price of $3500 in 19778 and Warrensville Atok, reserve senior Champion Bull, Adelaide 1979. Warrensville Lady Huron 50 was Senior and Grand Champion Female at the 1977 Adelaide Royal Show and her two sons , imperial and Pharoah were grand Champion Bulls at the 1977 and 1979 Adelaide Royal Shows.</p>
			
			<p>Two of the early females purchased were from the very successful Deepfields Stud in 1952 and were Deepfields Dawn 3 and Deepfields Madelon. They proved of such excellent quality that in the intervening years ten additional females were purchased and were from the Empress, Denise, Gloria, Hyacinth, Jessie, Jewel, lady Kansas, Lady Myuna, Marinda and Minerva families. These were mainly of Milton park and Golf hill bloodlines with some of Moreduval and Bexley descent.</p>
			
			<p>Three heifers were added on 1958 from The Braes Stud of J, D and R Hanson. The Quennie Lass and fancy families have bred well. Warrensville Sovereign, Junior Champion Bull, Adelaide 1075 was from Cannawigra Queenie Lass 4.</p>
			
			<p>Warrensville made an important supplement to the breeding herd in 1974 by purchasing females with Kildrummie Ukraine blood for $53,000 at the Glen Osmond Dispersal. They included 4 daughters of kildrummie Ukraine such as CBH Mediate 30 ($10,000), dam of Warrensville Monarch (retained) 1st 16-17 months Sydney Royal 1979 and 1st 22-24 Months Melbourne Royal 1979 and Glen Osmond Diana 3, ($14,000) and dam of Warrensville Tru-Robert 1st  18-24 months Adelaide Royal 1976. </p>
			
			<h3>The Foundation Sires</h3>
			
			<p>Mating at Warrensville has always been done with great selectivity, with attention to pedigree, physical attributes, and the results of previous matings. Sires selected for use must have the potential to contribute to the development of the herd. The performance of all sires are under continual review and their contribution must be significant to retain their place in the sire line-up. They must be from top performing females and their sires must have a grand record. Subsequently the herd’s performance is continually improving and Warrensville stock are making appositive contribution to both stud and commercial herds.</p>

			<p>Warrensville was developed with top sons of Australia’s outstanding imported sires: Deepfields Harper and Cannawigra Deputy by BEAU DOMINO  2 IMP USA  and deepfields Jester by HHR Domestic Mischief 6-106 IMP USA.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Deepfields Harper</strong> was used for 4 seasons and as a tribute to his performance as a sire was repurchased by Deepfields. He proved to be one of the best breeding sons of BEAU DOMINO 2 IMP USA and his progeny won many Championships at Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne Royal Shows.</p>

			<p><strong>Deepfieds Jester</strong> was a prepotent sire of prize winning stock with his progeny winning Grand Champion Bulls at the 1959 ad 1960 Adelaide Royal Shows.
			
			<p>A significant purchase was made in <strong>Kildrummie Cashmere</strong> in 1971 fro $10,000 when only 14 months.

Progeny grossed over $250,000 with a top son Warrensville Farivern selling for $11,000 to New Zealand  in 1974. His best son, Warrensville Imperial, Senior and Grand Champion at Adelaide in 1977 and Reserve Senior Champion Sydney 1977 was retained. He was considered to be a bull of vast importance at Warrensville and was considered by many cattlemen to be one of the best Poll Hereford bulls in Australia in his time.</p>

			<p>His son <strong>Warrensville Napoleon</strong> was Junior Champion at Adelaide Royal 1981 and 1st in his class 1982 Sydney Royal where he sold privately for $30,000 with semen retained for use in the herd.</p>
