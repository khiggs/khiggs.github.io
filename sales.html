			<h2>SALES</h2>
			
			<p>It seems like yesterday when we were planning our first Warrensville Production Sale for March 1974. I remember fondly our sale of Warrensville Fairvern for $11,000 to Charlie Lee, Leelands Poll Hereford stud and Scottie Johnson Lochnager Poll Hereford Stud, both in New Zealand.</p>
			<p>It is interesting to note that many of our sale bulls are grandsons of Kairuru Aberdeen 03 0047 IMP NZ through his son B220, a powerful bull in phenotype and genetically, a breed 600 day Growth Trait Leader with massive growth EBV’s of +97 (in top 1%). This gentle giant is a Trait leader for Scrotal Circumference and EMA EBV’s in top 5% of Breed with positive fat figures. The sire of Kairuru Aberdeen is none other than Leelands Transition T7 bred by Charlie and Margaret Lee.</p>
			<p>Over the years my passion for Herefords has not changed, their ability to fatten quickly and survive our dry periods is outstanding. All the sale bulls have been reared entirely on grass receiving a supplementary light grain ration from 22/01/14.</p>
			<p>In recent years we have taken teams of 5-6 bulls to the Wodonga Hereford National with good success. Last year we were proud to show the Reserve Senior Champion Bull (pictured below), two class winners and were the Runner-up Most Successful Exhibitor (by one point) out of some 41 exhibitors.</p>

			<p>Our Annual Bull sale is held in March each year, with a field day held in February to meet our stud bulls on offer.</p>
